## Features

- **Android 12 System**: x86_64 architecture, image ships with **libndk_translation** (Google's official NDK translation layer) enabled by default, supports x86_64/arm64-v8a/x86/armeabi-v7a/armeabi ABIs, most ARM apps can be installed and run directly
- **Browser Remote Control**: No client installation needed, open browser to control Android desktop
- **Dual Screen Casting Modes**:
  - WebRTC casting (low latency, high framerate, recommended for LAN)
  - WebSocket casting (good compatibility, auto-switch for external network/penetration environments)
- **fnOS Unified Gateway Adaptation**: One-click open via fnOS App Center, auto-inject login state, no secondary login required
- **ADB Debugging**: `adb connect <NAS_IP>:5556` to connect
- **File Management**: Manage files directly in the Android container within the Scrcpy interface
- **Terminal Access**: Built-in Android shell terminal
- **Serial Console**: Disabled by default to reduce performance overhead, developers can manually enable for debugging (see below)
- **Scrcpy Agent Integration**: Support connecting multiple Android devices/real phones, unified management
- **Simplified Chinese + China Timezone**: Container defaults to `zh_CN` + `Asia/Shanghai`
- **Non-root App Process**: gateway.py and other background processes run as `docker-androidemu` user , compliant with app store audit requirements
- **X86 / ARM Dual Platform**: Auto-detect architecture and GPU capabilities, X86 uses hardware acceleration, ARM auto-switches to software rendering
- **Performance Optimization**: webrtc/turn process high-priority scheduling, streamlined background services, CPU dynamic frequency scaling (see below)
- **60fps High Frame Rate**: Both redroid container and webrtc encoding upgraded to 60fps, encoding long edge 1280, bitrate 4-16Mbps dynamic adjustment, smoother video and more responsive touch/swipe
- **Safe Installation/Update Interruption**: Auto-cleanup of temporary data if installation or update is cancelled midway, preventing placeholder issues that block future installations 
- **Auto Container Detection**: Gateway auto-detects Android container status, container automatically comes online after startup, no manual operation needed
- **Installation Pre-check **: Auto-detects binder driver, memory (<1GB blocks), Docker availability, disk space (<2GB blocks), GPU capability before installation. Gives clear reasons on failure instead of generic "script execution error with unknown reason"
- **Optional GMS Installation**: Choose whether to install Google Services Framework (GMS) and Google Play Store in the installation wizard. If selected, the system automatically detects architecture (x86_64/arm64) and pulls corresponding files from the GMS image to install into the standard container. If not selected, the system remains pure Android, lightweight and stable
- **Container Health Check **: Real-time monitoring of boot status, uptime, OOM kills, surfaceflinger/agent processes. Auto-detects "boot timeout", "killed by OOM", "screen service abnormal" etc.
- **One-Click Fix **: Status page provides three buttons - "Fix GPU/Screen", "Restart Android Container", "Restart Screen Service" - no SSH command line needed for common issues
- **Friendly Status Page **: When upstream service is unavailable, shows a beautiful status page (container status table, troubleshooting tips, refresh button) instead of plain text "Bad Gateway"
- **Connection Stability Optimization **: WebSocket auto-reconnect (exponential backoff 1s→30s) + 25s heartbeat keepalive, TURN relay config optimization (no-loopback-peers, bps-capacity, max-allocate-lifetime=3600)
- **Immersive Fullscreen **: Desktop object-fit:contain, mobile cover, multi-selector compatible with different scrcpy-over-webrtc versions, click fullscreen button for true fullscreen
- **VAAPI Hardware Codec Dynamic Detection **: Auto-detects GPU VAAPI encoding (vainfo with EncSlice/EncPicture) and decoding (H264 VLD) support, enables hardware acceleration only when supported, auto-fallback to Google software codecs to avoid black screen/garbled video
- **NVIDIA GPU Support **: Auto-detects NVIDIA GPU and mounts devices and drivers, smart GPU selection priority Intel > AMD > NVIDIA
- **Dual Translation Layer Auto-Management **: Built-in libndk_translation (default) and libhoudini (auto-download), switch via bind mount over /system/lib*/libnb.so; auto mode detects ARMv8.1 instruction SIGILL crashes and switches to houdini, 5-minute anti-loop restart cooldown
- **Boot Performance Optimization **: lmkd threshold increased (max 315MB→3072MB) to reduce frequent process kills during boot, dex2oat uses verify-only mode for faster first boot, elevated system_server/surfaceflinger process priority
- **Domestic App Performance Optimization **: System-level optimizations for high-resource domestic apps (Douyin/Kuaishou etc.): background process limit (4), disable auto-sync/background data/network scanning, CPU/GPU deep optimization, animation half-speed (0.5), lmkd memory management optimization
- **Go Merged Daemon **: Audio fix + resolution auto-switch merged into single androidemu_daemon process, reducing Go runtime memory footprint (~5-8MB saved)
- **Optional Resource Limits **: Pre-configured commented CPU/memory limits in docker-compose.yaml, users can enable based on NAS performance

## Port Reference

This application uses the following ports. Only 8443 is automatically reverse-proxied by fnOS; all other ports must be handled manually depending on your use case:

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | LAN Use | External Access |
|------|----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| 8443 | TCP | scrcpy-over-webrtc Web UI + signaling | Auto (fnOS reverse proxy) | Requires manual reverse proxy / tunnel |
| 3478 | TCP+UDP | TURN/STUN relay (required for WebRTC casting) | Auto (host network) | Requires manual port mapping / tunnel |
| 5556 | TCP | ADB debugging (external adb connect) | **Localhost only by default** (manual open required for LAN) | Requires manual port mapping / tunnel |
| 50000-50100 | UDP | WebRTC media (TURN relay fallback) | Auto (host network) | Usually no need to expose; TURN works over 3478 |

> **Notes:**
> - The fnOS App Center `service_port` only declares 8443 for the unified gateway reverse proxy — it does not mean the app only listens on this one port.
> - The webrtc container uses `host` network mode, so 3478 and 50000-50100 listen directly on the host, no Docker port mapping needed.
> - ADB 5556 is forwarded by a host socat process to the Android container's port 5555 — not a Docker mapping.
> - 8443, 3478, and 50000-50100 work automatically on the LAN with no configuration.
> - For external access: 8443 goes through a reverse proxy; if using WebRTC casting externally, port 3478 (TCP+UDP) must also be reachable, otherwise you get a black screen or endless loading.



## Installation Requirements

| Item | Minimum | Recommended |
|------|---------|-------------|
| System | fnOS 1.1.8+ | Latest fnOS |
| Architecture | x86_64 / aarch64 | x86_64 |
| CPU | 2 cores | 4 cores+ |
| Memory | 2 GB | 4 GB+ |
| Storage | 4 GB free | 8 GB+ (including ~2GB image) |
| Network | LAN | — |

> **X86 devices**: Docker needs `/dev/dri` passthrough for hardware acceleration; auto-fallback to software rendering if no GPU; must install binder_linux driver before downloading (available in App Center, just search), otherwise app won't work or installation will be rejected.
> **ARM devices**: Auto uses software rendering (gpu_mode=guest), no extra driver needed, and binder_linux is not required.
>
> **Architecture Compatibility**: x86_64 has been thoroughly tested on fnOS. ARM64 (aarch64) is adapted at the code level (auto software rendering, in-container binderfs, architecture detection), but due to limited test devices, ARM users are advised to monitor boot status after installation. Feedback is welcome via the channels below.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: fnOS App Center (Recommended)

1. Open fnOS App Center
2. Search for "Android Emulator" or "androidemu"
3. Click install, follow the wizard:
   - **Google Services (GMS)**: Choose whether to install Google Services Framework and Play Store (default: not installed, lightweight and stable)
   - **Resolution**: Optional, auto-adapts to multiple devices
   - **Ports**: Optional, defaults work fine
4. Wait for image pull to complete (~2GB, priority DaoCloud/fnOS mirror)
5. Click "Open" after installation to enter Scrcpy interface

> **Note**: If GMS installation is selected, the container will automatically detect system architecture (x86_64/arm64) on first boot, pull the corresponding GMS image and extract files to install to system partitions, then restart automatically. The whole process takes about 3-5 minutes (depending on network speed). GMS requires a network environment to log in and use normally.

### Method 2: Manual fpk Installation

1. Download latest `androidemu_all_x.x.x.fpk`
2. Select "Manual Install" in fnOS App Center, upload fpk file
3. Wait for installation and image pull to complete

### Image Acceleration

Installation automatically tries image sources in this order:
1. fnOS mirror `docker.fnnas.com`
2. DaoCloud free mirror `docker.m.daocloud.io`
3. Docker Hub official repository

If all fail, configure image accelerator (registry-mirrors) in fnOS Docker settings and retry.

> **Download Speed Note**: First-time installation pulls ~2GB Android container image. During peak evening hours (typically 20:00-24:00), international bandwidth is congested and slower download speeds are normal — please be patient or retry during daytime. It is recommended to configure an appropriate mirror accelerator in fnOS **Docker → Image Registry → Settings → Mirror Settings**.

## GMS Service

### Overview

GMS (Google Mobile Services) is a set of proprietary service components provided by Google, including Google Play Services, Google Play Store, Google Services Framework, Google Account Manager, etc. After installing GMS, you can use the Play Store to download apps, receive Google push notifications, and use apps that rely on Google services.

GMS in this app is **optional**: the installation wizard defaults to "Do not install", keeping a pure Android system that is lightweight and stable. Users must actively select "Install" and confirm the legal notice before installation is triggered. The app installation package itself **does not contain any GMS binary files**; GMS files are extracted from a separate file carrier image at installation time.

### Architecture Support

GMS service supports both x86_64 and arm64 architectures. The installation script automatically detects the system architecture (`uname -m`) and pulls the corresponding version:

| Architecture | GMS Image | Source |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| x86_64 | `ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:x86_64-1.0.0` | Extracted from third-party redroid derivative image (whojk/redroid:12.0.0_mindthegapps) |
| arm64 | `ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:arm64-1.0.0` | Extracted from official MindTheGapps 12.1.0-arm64 package |

- x86_64 version: MindTheGapps officially does not provide x86_64 prebuilt packages, so system files are extracted from a third-party redroid image with GMS integrated
- arm64 version: Uses the official MindTheGapps arm64 release package
- Both images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and are publicly pullable

### Installation

**Step 1: Select in Installation Wizard**

In the "Google Services (GMS)" step of the installation wizard, select "Install GMS Service and Play Store", read and confirm the legal notice, then continue.

**Step 2: Auto-detect Architecture and Pull Image**

After the container first starts, the installation script automatically detects the system architecture and pulls the corresponding GMS file carrier image (~560-700MB) from GHCR. Pulling supports multi-source fallback:
1. Nanjing University mirror `ghcr.nju.edu.cn`
2. DaoCloud mirror `docker.m.daocloud.io`
3. GHCR official `ghcr.io`

> **Download Speed Note**: The GMS image is ~560-700MB. Slower download speeds during peak evening hours are normal — please be patient or retry during daytime. If pulling fails, the script automatically tries the next mirror source.

**Step 3: Extract Files and Install to System Partition**

After the image is pulled, the script creates a temporary container via `docker create`, extracts GMS files using a `docker export | tar -x` pipeline, and copies them to `/system/priv-app/`, `/system/app/`, `/system/framework/`, `/system/etc/` and other directories according to the Android 12 partition structure, with correct permissions (chmod 644/755).

**Step 4: Wait for System Ready and Restart Container**

The script waits for `sys.boot_completed=1` and core services (surfaceflinger/mediaserver/adbd) to be ready, then restarts the Android container for GMS to take effect.

**Step 5: Automatic Cleanup**

After successful GMS installation, the script automatically deletes the GMS file carrier image (~560-700MB) to free disk space — no manual cleanup required.

The entire installation process takes approximately 3-10 minutes (depending on network speed and NAS performance).

### Verification After Installation

After installation, you can verify whether GMS was installed successfully via:

**Method 1: Check App List**

Open scrcpy-over-webrtc; the "Play Store" (Google Play Store) icon should appear in the Android app list.

**Method 2: Command Line Check**

```bash
docker exec androidemu-android pm list packages | grep google
```

You should see these packages:
- `com.google.android.gsf` — Google Services Framework
- `com.google.android.gms` — Google Play Services
- `com.android.vending` — Google Play Store

**Method 3: Check Installation Log**

```bash
cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/gms_install.log
```

The log records each step's execution status and result.

### FAQ

**Q: GMS image pull fails, what should I do?**

A: The script automatically tries multiple mirror sources (Nanjing University → DaoCloud → GHCR official). If all fail:
1. Check NAS network connection and DNS configuration
2. Configure an available mirror accelerator in fnOS **Docker → Image Registry → Settings → Mirror Settings**
3. Configure a proxy in fnOS **Docker → Image Registry → Settings → Proxy Settings** (if network egress is restricted)
4. Manually pull the image then retry: `docker pull ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:x86_64-1.0.0` (x86_64) or `docker pull ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:arm64-1.0.0` (arm64)

**Q: After installing GMS, scrcpy keeps connecting/disconnecting, then stabilizes after a while — is this normal?**

A: This is normal. After GMS installation completes, the Android container restarts. After restart, GMS core components (GmsCore, GoogleServicesFramework, Play Store, etc.) need to perform first-boot dex optimization, service registration, permission initialization, and network handshake. This process typically lasts 1-3 minutes. During this time, scrcpy may show "Connecting" or repeatedly disconnect/reconnect. Please be patient and do not frequently refresh or restart the container.

**Q: Black screen or boot failure after installing GMS?**

A: GMS installation failure may cause system issues. Solution:
1. Check installation log: `cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/gms_install.log`
2. If installation failed, uninstall the current app (select "Keep data"), reinstall and select "Do not install GMS"
3. After reinstallation, the system returns to normal and data is preserved

**Q: Already installed Standard Edition, want to add GMS?**

A: Currently GMS can only be selected during installation. Users who already installed Standard Edition need to:
1. Uninstall the current app (select "Keep data" — installed apps and data will not be lost)
2. Reinstall, select "Install GMS Service and Play Store" in the wizard
3. After installation, data is preserved and GMS is automatically installed

**Q: After GMS installation completes, can the GMS image be deleted?**

A: Yes. The GMS image is only used for file extraction during installation and is no longer needed afterward. In v3.8.7+, the installation script **automatically deletes** the GMS image after successful installation. To manually clean up:
```bash
docker rmi ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:x86_64-1.0.0   # x86_64
docker rmi ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:arm64-1.0.0    # arm64
```
After deletion, if you need to reinstall GMS in the future (e.g., after uninstalling and reinstalling), the image will be re-pulled from the registry.

**Q: What's the difference between this GMS and the old GMS edition image?**

A:
- **Old GMS edition (before 3.8.7)**: Directly used the third-party whojk/redroid image as the Android container; GPU host mode was incompatible with some hardware causing black screen
- **New GMS (3.8.7+)**: Always uses the official redroid standard image as the Android container; GPU mode works normally. During installation, architecture is auto-detected and files are extracted from a separate GMS file carrier image into the system partition — no black screen issues. The app package itself does not contain GMS binary files

### Uninstall & Reinstall

- **Uninstall app**: Click "Uninstall" in fnOS App Center, choose whether to keep data. When keeping data, apps and data inside the Android container are not lost, but GMS service is removed along with the container
- **Reinstall**: During reinstallation, select "Install GMS" again in the wizard; the script will re-pull the GMS image and install
- **Remove GMS only without reinstalling**: Currently not supported. To remove GMS, you need to uninstall the app then reinstall and select "Do not install GMS"

### Legal Notice

GMS (Google Mobile Services) is proprietary software of Google LLC, protected by copyright law and relevant international treaties. The app installation package itself does not contain any GMS binary files; only after the user actively selects "Install GMS Service" are files extracted at runtime from a separate GMS file carrier image and installed into the Android container.

- Use of GMS is subject to Google's relevant terms of service and privacy policy
- This project has not obtained official Google authorization or MADA certification; distribution and use of GMS may carry legal risks, and is limited to personal learning and research purposes
- For commercial use or large-scale distribution, you must obtain formal authorization from Google yourself
- Commercial users are recommended to prioritize open-source compliant alternatives such as microG

## Access Methods

### LAN (Recommended, Full Features)

Click "Open" in fnOS App Center, or directly access:
```
https://<NAS_IP>:<NAS_PORT>/app/androidemu/
```
Can also directly access screen service native port:
```
https://<NAS_IP>:8443
```

WebRTC casting works normally in LAN, low latency, high framerate, all features (file management, terminal, casting settings etc.) available.

### fnOS Official Remote Domain (xxx.fnos.net)

When accessing via fnOS official remote domain:
- ✅ WebSocket casting auto-enabled, can view and control screen
- ⚠️ File management etc. relying on WebRTC DataChannel (UDP) may not work
- ⚠️ Framerate and latency affected by upstream bandwidth

> Reason: fnOS reverse proxy only passes TCP (HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket), not UDP. WebRTC media stream uses UDP, so auto-downgrades to WebSocket casting.
>
> v3.6.7+ enhanced external network auto-adaptation: auto-detect and switch to WebSocket casting mode, if switch fails then provide MJPEG fallback screen, ensuring external network access always available.

### fnOS APP

When accessing via fnOS mobile APP built-in browser:
- ⚠️ Some versions of fnOS APP WebView have limited WebSocket proxy support, may show "waiting for device push stream timeout"
- ✅ Recommended to use mobile browser (Chrome / Edge / system browser) to open fnOS remote domain directly

### Public IP / Intranet Penetration / Reverse Proxy

If you have public IP or use intranet penetration (frp, ZeroTier, Tailscale etc.):
- ✅ Map port 8443 to external network, can use WebRTC casting directly
- ✅ Need to set "External access address (WebRTC media stream)" in "Casting Settings" to your public domain or IP
- ✅ TURN relay server built-in, ensure UDP 3478 port reachable

#### External Network Access Guide (Important)

**Limitations of fnOS remote domain (xxx.fnos.net):**
- fnOS reverse proxy **only passes TCP**, WebRTC UDP media streams cannot pass through
- Therefore, when accessing via fnOS remote domain, **only WS casting works** (TCP), WebRTC casting will fail
- File management, terminal (ADB), etc. rely on WebRTC DataChannel (UDP), **not available externally**
- WS casting first tries WebRTC (UDP), then falls back to WS after timeout, so **initial connection may take 10-30 seconds**

**Recommended external access solution (full functionality):**

Use frp or other intranet penetration tools to **expose both TCP 8443 and UDP 3478**:

```ini
# frpc.ini example
[androidemu_web]
type = tcp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 8443
remote_port = 8443

[androidemu_turn]
type = udp
local_ip = 127.0.0.1
local_port = 3478
remote_port = 3478
```

After configuration, access via `http://<your-domain>:8443`, all features including WebRTC casting, file management, and terminal are available.

**How to fix slow WS casting connection:**
1. Wait 10-30 seconds patiently, WebRTC will timeout and auto-fallback to WS
2. Or manually click "Switch to WebSocket casting" button on the connection page to use WS immediately
3. After exposing UDP 3478 via frp, WebRTC connects directly without waiting

- If showing "0 devices online", see the FAQ troubleshooting section

### 4. Screen Casting

1. In「Cloud VM」, click an online device to open the screen
2. First connection uses **WebRTC** mode (best quality, low latency)
3. If WebRTC fails, use the mode switch button at the top to switch to **WebSocket (WS)** mode
4. Screen controls:
   - **Click**: Left mouse click = Android touch
   - **Swipe**: Hold left button and drag = Android swipe gesture
   - **Zoom**: Mouse wheel = pinch-to-zoom
   - **Back**: Side toolbar back button, or press Esc
   - **Home**: Side toolbar home button, or press Home
   - **Recent apps**: Side toolbar recent button
   - **Keyboard input**: Type directly on keyboard — input goes to the focused field
   - **Volume**: Side toolbar volume +/- buttons

### 5. Install APK

**Method 1: Batch install (recommended)**
1. Click「Files」→ select「Batch Install/Transfer」tab
2. Drag APK files to the upload area, or click to upload
3. Select target devices (check the devices to install on)
4. Task type:「Silent install APK」
5. Click「Dispatch batch task」and wait for completion

**Method 2: Single device install**
1. Open the device screen
2. Find the「Install APK」button in the side toolbar
3. Select a local APK file to upload and install

> Uploaded APK files are not auto-deleted after installation. Manually click「Remove」on the Files page, or see the FAQ for cleanup methods.

### 6. Terminal (ADB Debugging)

   ```
   pm list packages
   ```

   Uninstall an app (replace `<package>` with the actual package name):
   ```
   pm uninstall <package>
   ```

   Check if Android finished booting:
   ```
   getprop sys.boot_completed
   ```
4. You can also connect externally with `adb connect <NAS_IP>:5556`

### 7. File Management

- 「Files」→「File Center」to browse and manage files on the Android device
- Supports upload to device, download from device, and delete files
- 「Batch Install/Transfer」for sending APKs or files to multiple devices simultaneously

### 8. Using the Mobile APP (Optional)

Cloud Phone officially provides a standalone **Android APP client**, offering a better mobile experience than browser (true fullscreen, no address bar, background keep-alive).

**Download and install:**
1. Open https://webrtc-phone.com/#download in your phone browser
2. Download `ScrcpyOverWebRTC-release.apk` and install it
3. Open the APP, enter your access address in the address bar:
   - LAN: `http://<NAS_IP>:8443`
   - External: your fnOS remote domain or reverse proxy address
4. Log in with default account `admin` / `admin123` (or your modified account)
5. Tap a device to start screen mirroring and control

> The APP and browser access the same server, with fully synchronized data and configuration. The APP's advantages are mobile-optimized UX and background keep-alive; core features are identical to the browser.

## ADB Connection

> **Important**: ADB is an Android debugging channel — **it only runs commands, installs APKs, and debugs; it does NOT stream the screen**. To view the Android screen, use the Scrcpy-over-WebRTC web interface (`http://<NAS_IP>:8443`) or the Scrcpy-over-WebRTC mobile APP. Remote control tools like Scrcpy / QtScrcpy that depend on scrcpy-server are **incompatible** (this container uses cloudphone-agent, no scrcpy-server), and will show endless loading with no screen.

ADB 5556 **binds to 127.0.0.1 by default** (security: ADB has no password), accessible from the NAS itself only. To connect from another LAN device (e.g. your PC), first manually open the port:

### 1. Open ADB Port 5556

**Step 1: SSH into the NAS and edit the config file**

```bash
nano /var/apps/androidemu/var/ports.conf
```

Add or modify the following line:

```
ADB_BIND=0.0.0.0
```

> nano controls: press `Ctrl+O` to save, press `Enter` to confirm filename, press `Ctrl+X` to exit.

**Step 2: Restart the ADB forwarder**

```bash
sudo pkill -f redroid_adb_forward.sh && sudo bash /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/scripts/redroid_adb_forward.sh install
```

**Step 3: Verify the port is open**

```bash
ss -tln | grep 5556
```

It should show `0.0.0.0:5556`, meaning it's listening on all network interfaces.

### 2. Connect to Android Container

**Step 4: Connect from your PC**

Replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NAS's actual LAN IP address:

```bash
adb connect <NAS_IP>:5556
```

A successful connection shows `connected to <NAS_IP>:5556`.

**Step 5: Enter Android shell**

```bash
adb shell
```

Once inside, you can run Android commands (e.g. `pm list packages` to list installed apps).

> You can also skip ADB and use Android shell directly in the "Terminal" of the Scrcpy interface.

> ⚠️ **Security note**: ADB has no password authentication. When done, change back to `ADB_BIND=127.0.0.1` and restart the forwarder to avoid leaving the port exposed.

## APK Installation

1. Click "File" or "Upload" in Scrcpy interface
2. Select APK file to upload
3. Click APK in file manager within Android container to install

> **Note**: This app is x86_64 architecture. Image has built-in ARM translation layer, most ARM apps can run; but ARM64 apps with anti-emulator detection or complex JIT may crash on startup (translation layer capability boundary).

---

## Performance Optimization

This app has multiple built-in performance optimizations to reduce access and usage latency:

### 1. Process Priority Boost

webrtc signaling service and TURN relay service both start with `nice=-10` (higher than default priority), reducing CPU scheduling latency, avoiding screen stutter.

> Technical detail: Docker containers default drop `CAP_SYS_NICE`, this app explicitly adds `cap_add: SYS_NICE` in compose, this capability only affects process scheduling priority, not device/network/filesystem access.

### 2. Background Service Streamlining

After container startup, automatically disable unnecessary Android system services, releasing CPU and memory:
- Bluetooth services (`com.android.bluetooth`, `com.android.bluetoothmidiservice`) — container has no Bluetooth hardware
- NFC service (`com.android.nfc`) — container has no NFC hardware
- Print service (`com.android.printspooler`) — container doesn't need printing
- Backup services (`com.android.backupconfirm`, `com.android.sharedstoragebackup`) — container doesn't need backup

> **Note**: `com.android.location.fused` (location fused service) cannot be disabled, it's a dependency of LocationManagerService, disabling will cause system_server crash and Android won't boot.

### 3. CPU Dynamic Frequency Scaling

Installation auto-configures CPU governor to dynamic frequency mode (schedutil/ondemand), sets minimum frequency to 40% of maximum:
- Light load: CPU won't drop too low, ensuring operation response speed
- Heavy load: auto-rise to maximum frequency, full performance
- Only works on devices supporting cpufreq, silently skips if not supported
- Won't go below quad-core CPU limit (dynamic adjustment, won't over-restrict performance)

### 4. Serial Console Disabled by Default

Android serial console (`androidboot.console=0`) disabled by default, reducing performance overhead from kernel log output. Developers can manually enable if needed (see below).

### 5. GPU Hardware Acceleration

- **X86 devices**: Auto-detect `/dev/dri`, uses `gpu_mode=host` hardware acceleration when GPU present, 60fps
- **ARM devices**: Auto uses `gpu_mode=guest` software rendering, 60fps (unified high frame rate; low-end devices can revert to 30fps in compose if laggy)

### 6. Domestic App Optimization 

Domestic App Performance Optimization : System-level optimizations for high-resource domestic apps (Douyin/Kuaishou etc.):

| Optimization | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Background process limit** | `background_process_limit=4`, system more aggressively reclaims excess processes |
| **Disable auto-sync** | `auto_sync=0`, reduces background sync overhead |
| **Disable background data** | `mobile_data_always_on=0`, prevents background data/CPU usage |
| **Disable scanning** | WiFi/BLE scan off, reduces location and background wakeups |
| **Disable network optimizers** | Turn off network recommendations, adaptive connectivity |
| **Animation half-speed** | Window/transition/animator scale set to 0.5, smooth yet CPU-efficient |
| **GPU forced rendering** | `debug.hwui.renderer=skiagl`, GPU renders UI |
| **Layer composition optimization** | `disable_backpressure=1`, `latch_unsignaled=1`, reduces composition latency |
| **Memory management optimization** | Adjusted lmkd thresholds, more aggressive background app memory reclamation |

### 7. Optional Resource Limits 

If your NAS has limited performance, enable resource limits in `docker-compose.yaml` (commented by default, uncomment to enable):

```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '4.0'      # Max 4 CPU cores
      memory: 4G       # Max 4GB memory
```

> Restart container after modification: `docker compose -f /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/app/docker/docker-compose.yaml restart`

---

## Serial Console (Developer Debugging)

Serial console disabled by default to reduce performance overhead. To enable for debugging:

```bash
# Temporarily enable (lost after container restart)
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android setprop persist.sys.serialconsole 1
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android start console

# View console output
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android dmesg -w

# Disable
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android stop console
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android setprop persist.sys.serialconsole 0
```

> Note: Enabling serial console increases kernel log output, may slightly affect performance, recommended to disable after debugging.

## Tech Stack & Translation Layers

androidemu goes through **3 core translation/conversion layers** from hardware to browser display, plus 1 optional instruction-set translation layer:

### Layer 1: Containerization Layer (Docker)

- Not a full VM, but **process-level container isolation**. Android userspace runs directly on the host Linux kernel
- Shares the same kernel with the host, **does not translate CPU instructions**, near-native performance
- Provides filesystem, network, and process isolation; the Android container runs in `privileged` mode (required by upstream redroid for binder device access)

### Layer 2: GPU Rendering Translation Layer

| Mode | Scenario | Mechanism | FPS |
|------|----------|-----------|-----|
| GPU passthrough (guest) | X86 with iGPU/dGPU | Android OpenGL ES commands sent directly to host GPU driver, almost no translation overhead | 60fps |
| Software rendering (swiftshader) | No GPU / ARM devices | **swiftshader** translates OpenGL ES into CPU instructions, with translation overhead | 60fps (low-end devices can revert to 30fps) |

- Install script automatically detects host GPU capability; uses GPU passthrough when `/dev/dri` exists, otherwise falls back to software rendering
- ARM devices use software rendering (swiftshader) by default

### Layer 3: Display Capture & Encoding Layer

- **scrcpy** captures frames via Android's surfaceflinger
- Encodes into **H.264** video stream (2-10Mbps bitrate, 960px long edge)
- Transmits to browser via **WebRTC** (TURN/STUN relay + P2P)
- Browser decodes and displays; **audio is enabled** (3.7.5+ fix: enable Codec2 framework to load c2.android.opus.encoder software encoder)

### Layer 4: ABI Instruction-Set Translation Layer (libndk_translation, enabled by default)

- redroid image ships with **libndk_translation** (Google's official NDK translation solution), implementing ARM-to-x86 binary translation via the Native Bridge mechanism
- Verified config: `ro.dalvik.vm.native.bridge=libnb.so` (symlink to `libndk_translation.so`)
- Supported ABIs: `x86_64, arm64-v8a, x86, armeabi-v7a, armeabi` (five architectures, ARM apps run directly)
- Image does **not** include libhoudini (Intel solution) or QEMU translator (only related property files, not an actual translator)
- X86 devices: Android x86_64 native + libndk_translation for ARM apps
- ARM devices: Android arm64 native, no translation layer needed

## Audit Compliance Notes

This app has passed fnOS official 7-point self-check (basic info, permission declaration, network ports, data storage, start/stop, uninstall cleanup, compatibility). Below are detailed explanations of audit focus points:

### 1. Privileged Container

- **Status**: Only `androidemu-android` (redroid Android main container) uses `privileged: true`, `androidemu-webrtc` (screen service) runs non-privileged
- **Necessity**: redroid upstream (remote-android/redroid-doc) official deployment requires `--privileged`, Android depends on kernel binder communication, container needs to mount/access binder device and create device nodes
- **Non-privileged alternative tested infeasible**: Non-privileged + device_cgroup_rule + mount binderfs + cap-add=ALL + seccomp=unconfined, container exits with ExitCode 0 silently, can't boot (redroid-doc issue #591 still open)
- **Impact control**: Privilege only applies inside container (container root = Android system initialization needs), not equal to host root; app itself runs as `docker-androidemu` user, doesn't request host root

### 2. Non-root App Process 

- gateway.py, audio_fix.py and other background processes all run as `docker-androidemu` user
- Auto-downgrade via `_drop_privileges()` function (auto-switch when uid=0)
- config/privilege declares `run-as=package`

### 3. Host Network Mode

- `androidemu-webrtc` container uses `network_mode: host`
- **Reason**: fnOS blocks "bridge container → host LAN IP" access, bridge mode prevents screen service backend from connecting to local ADB port
- **Impact**: Listening ports exactly same as original port mapping (8443 TCP, 3478 TCP/UDP, 50000-50100 UDP), no new ports; container still doesn't use privileged

### 4. Docker Group Permission

- App user `docker-androidemu` belongs to `docker` group
- This is standard configuration for fnOS Docker apps, required to run containers
- Only used for app scripts to orchestrate and clean up this app's containers, doesn't affect other apps

### 5. Multi-port Listening

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Auth |
|------|----------|---------|------|
| 8443 | TCP | WebRTC signaling + screen | Account login |
| 3478 | TCP/UDP | TURN relay | TURN credentials |
| 5556 | TCP | ADB debugging | Default localhost only, manual open needed |
| 50000-50100 | UDP | WebRTC media stream | Session-level auth |

- App doesn't do any automatic port mapping (no UPnP/hole punching), public exposure decided by user
- Each port has independent auth mechanism

### 6. Paid Features Note

- This app itself is completely free
- Built-in Scrcpy screen service uses upstream third-party authorization: free version can use all basic features (screen casting, ADB debugging etc.), only "addable device count" is limited
- Paid only increases device count limit, doesn't affect any functionality
- Fees collected by upstream authorization service provider, unrelated to fnOS official

### 7. GMS (Google Mobile Services) Compliance Note

- **App package does not contain GMS binaries**: The FPK package is only ~150KB, no Google proprietary software included
- **GMS is optional**: Installation wizard defaults to "Do not install"; user must actively select "Install" and confirm the legal notice before triggering
- **Runtime acquisition**: After selecting install, the script automatically detects system architecture (x86_64/arm64), extracts files from a separate GMS file carrier image, and installs to the standard redroid container's system partitions
- **GMS source**: x86_64 GMS files extracted from third-party redroid derivative image (whojk/redroid); arm64 version from the MindTheGapps open project; both are third-party repackaging of Google proprietary software
- **Legal responsibility**: GMS (Google Mobile Services) is proprietary software of Google LLC, protected by copyright. This project does not directly distribute GMS binaries, for personal research only. Use of GMS is subject to Google's Terms of Service, and legal responsibility rests with the user
- **Compliant alternative**: If only basic features like push notifications, location, and maps are needed, the open-source microG (Apache 2.0 license) is recommended, with no legal risk
- **Auto-cleanup after GMS install**: After successful GMS installation, the GMS file carrier image (~700MB) is automatically removed to free disk space, no manual cleanup needed
- **GMS parallel pre-download**: When GMS is selected during installation, the GMS image is downloaded in parallel with the Android system image in the background; after container boot, files are extracted directly, significantly reducing total installation time
- **Domestic mirror acceleration**: GMS image pull supports multi-source fallback (Nanjing University ghcr.nju.edu.cn → DaoCloud docker.m.daocloud.io → GHCR official), automatically selecting the fastest available source in domestic network environments
- **Auto-retry on failure**: If GMS installation encounters boot timeout or image pull failure, the installation marker file is not removed; it automatically retries on next container boot, avoiding the "thought it was installed but actually wasn't" issue

## FAQ

### Q: "Unable to install Android Emulator (China) - Unknown error" when installing via fnOS mobile app

A: This is a generic error from the **fnOS mobile app** App Center, occurring at the app center level (before the installation script runs). It is not an issue with this application.

**Possible causes and solutions:**
1. **Use the web version first**: Open the fnOS management page in a desktop browser and install via the web App Center. The mobile app occasionally throws this "Unknown error", while the web version usually works fine
2. **Check disk space**: The Android image is about 2GB, plus temporary files require at least 4GB of free space
3. **Restart the fnOS app**: Fully close the app and reopen it, then try again
4. **Manual installation**: Download the fpk package and upload it via the web version's "Manual Install"

If none of the above works, please feedback via any link in the "Feedback Links & Channels" section below, including your NAS model, system version, and screenshots.

### Q: "Unable to install - State operation not supported, returns current app state and business state" when installing via fnOS mobile app

A: This is a state machine error from the **fnOS mobile app** App Center, usually caused by the app being in an abnormal state (e.g., previous installation/update cancelled midway, repeatedly clicking the install button, leftover installation process).

**Solutions:**
1. **Don't click repeatedly**: Wait for the current operation to complete. Do not repeatedly click install/update buttons during installation
2. **Restart the fnOS app**: Fully close the app and reopen it to refresh app state
3. **Use the web version**: Open the fnOS management page in a desktop browser and perform install/update/uninstall operations via the web App Center
4. **Clean up leftover state**: If the app shows "Installed" but is actually unusable, uninstall it first in the web version, then reinstall

### Q: "Unable to install androidemu - script execution error with unknown reason" during first-time installation

A: First check if the **binder driver** is installed:
- **x86 devices**: Install the "binder_linux driver" dependency app from the fnOS App Center first, which creates the `/dev/binder` device node, then install this app
- **ARM devices**: Most devices have binder built into the kernel (e.g., RK3588), but some stripped kernels may not have it enabled. Verify kernel support for `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC` / binderfs

If the driver is already installed (or the ARM device natively supports it) but this error still appears, please feedback via any link in the "Feedback Links & Channels" section below, and include `/var/apps/androidemu/var/uninstall_init.log` or the corresponding installation log so we can investigate the specific cause.

### Q: Can't open after installation, page shows 400 error (may affect multiple apps simultaneously)

A: This is caused by the request header size limit of fnOS nginx gateway, **not an issue with this app**.

**Cause**: fnOS nginx defaults to `large_client_header_buffers 4 8k`. When browser cookies are too large (cumulative cookies injected by fnOS gateway such as `fnos-token`, `osrt`, etc. exceed 8KB), nginx directly returns 400. This issue affects all apps going through the fnOS gateway simultaneously (such as gxsales, hddlocator, etc.). Clearing browser cache temporarily fixes it, but cookies grow again after re-login.

**Solution A (recommended, works immediately): Bypass fnOS nginx, access port directly**

Access directly within LAN:
```
http://<NAS_IP>:8443
```

Or access through your own reverse proxy (e.g. Lucky, Nginx Proxy Manager), bypassing the fnOS gateway.

**Solution B (permanent fix): Modify fnOS nginx config to increase header buffer size**

> Requires SSH login to NAS with root permission. Backup config file before modifying.

Step 1: Backup nginx config
```bash
sudo cp /usr/trim/nginx/conf/nginx.conf /usr/trim/nginx/conf/nginx.conf.bak
```

Step 2: Edit config file
```bash
sudo nano /usr/trim/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```

Add the following two lines inside the `http {}` block:
```
client_header_buffer_size 16k;
large_client_header_buffers 4 32k;
```

Step 3: Test config and reload
```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
```

> Note: fnOS system updates may overwrite nginx config. If the issue reappears after an update, re-add the lines.

### Q: Shows "Bad Gateway" (502 error) after opening

A: This is the default prompt from fnOS nginx gateway when it can't reach the backend service, **not an error page from this app**.

**Most common cause: Just installed/just started, backend service not ready yet**

The Android container takes 1-2 minutes on first boot (pulling image, initializing, starting system services). During this time gateway.py or the webrtc container is not ready yet, and fnOS gateway directly returns 502. **Wait 1-2 minutes then refresh the page.**

**By version:**

- **v3.6.8 and below**: Showing plain text "Bad Gateway" is normal. Older versions don't have a friendly status page, this is what you see when upstream is not ready. Refresh after the container finishes starting.
- **v3.7.0 and above**: Normally shows a friendly status page (with container status table and refresh button) when upstream is not ready. If you still see plain text "Bad Gateway", it means the gateway.py process didn't start at all. Troubleshoot:

Step 1: Check if port 8443 is listening
```bash
ss -tln | grep 8443
```

Step 2: Check if gateway.py process is running
```bash
ps aux | grep gateway.py | grep -v grep
```

Step 3: If port is not listening or process doesn't exist, click "Stop" then "Start" in the App Center, or restart the app.

Step 4: You can also bypass fnOS gateway and access directly to confirm if it's a gateway-layer issue:
```
http://<NAS_IP>:8443
```

### Q: Shows "Unauthorized" or "0 devices online" after opening

A: This is Scrcpy License authorization prompt. Newly installed devices currently have a 20-device 3-month free trial (this offer is valid until Nov 1, 2026; after expiration, the free quota will be reduced to 10 devices; other basic features remain unaffected). Wait for container to fully start (~1-2 minutes) then refresh page. If still unauthorized, check if container is running:
```bash
docker ps --filter name=androidemu
```

### Q: "Unable to update - script execution error with unknown reason" during upgrade

A: This is caused by `uninstall_init` script exception during upgrade in old versions (v3.6.5 and before). Fixed in v3.6.6:
- Rewrote uninstall script with more robust upgrade guard
- Added `set +e` to ensure no command failure causes abnormal script exit
- All output redirected to log, stdout stays clean

**Solution**: Download v3.6.6+ and install via "Manual Install" to overwrite. If still fails, check log on NAS:
```bash
cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/uninstall_init.log
```

### Q: WebRTC casting connection failed

A: Troubleshoot in this order:
1. Confirm using in LAN (external network auto-downgrades to WebSocket casting)
2. Confirm TURN server running: `docker exec androidemu-webrtc netstat -ulnp | grep 3478`
3. Confirm PUBLIC_IP is LAN IP not 127.0.0.1: `docker exec androidemu-webrtc env | grep PUBLIC_IP`
4. Confirm ICE_SERVERS contains correct LAN IP: `docker exec androidemu-webrtc env | grep ICE_SERVERS`
5. Try clicking "Switch to WebSocket casting"

### Q: WebSocket (WS) casting shows connection failed

A: When using WebSocket casting (LAN or external network), if "Connection failed" page appears, please wait patiently:
- **Within 2 minutes**: System will automatically retry and connect, eventually showing Android container homepage, no action needed
- **Still connection failed after 2 minutes**: Troubleshoot as follows:
  1. Confirm Android container has fully started (first boot takes ~1-2 minutes), check container status in fnOS Docker
  2. Refresh page and re-enter
  3. LAN users can try directly accessing `https://<NAS_IP>:8443`
  4. External network users can use MJPEG fallback screen from top-right prompt
  5. If still unresolved, check container logs or contact us via feedback channels

### Q: Container restarts repeatedly

A: Common causes and troubleshooting:

**1. Check Android container logs**

```bash
docker logs androidemu-android
```

**2. Identify cause by log keywords:**

| Log keyword | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Errors related to `gpu`, `dri`, `SurfaceFlinger` | GPU passthrough failed | See GPU fix commands in "Android container memory very low" below |
| `out of memory`, `lowmemory` | Insufficient RAM | Close other apps, keep at least 2GB free |
| Errors related to `binder`, `binderfs` | binder driver missing | x86: install `binder_linux` driver from App Center first |

**3. ARM device extra check:** Confirm compose has `androidboot.redroid_gpu_mode=guest` (software rendering), ARM devices usually have no GPU passthrough.

**4. webrtc container restarts repeatedly:** Search logs for `nice: setpriority(-10): Permission denied`. If present, confirm compose includes `cap_add: SYS_NICE`.

Check webrtc container logs:
```bash
docker logs androidemu-webrtc --tail 50
```

### Q: I selected GMS during installation, how to verify it's installed?

A: After installation, open Scrcpy and you should see the "Play Store" icon in the app list. You can also check via command:
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android pm list packages | grep google
```
You should see `com.google.android.gsf` (Services Framework), `com.google.android.gms` (Play Services), `com.android.vending` (Play Store).

If not, check the GMS installation log:
```bash
cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/gms_install.log
```

### Q: Black screen or boot failure after installing GMS?

A: GMS installation failure may cause system issues. Solution:
1. Uninstall the current app (select "Keep data")
2. Reinstall, select "Do not install GMS" in the wizard
3. System returns to normal after installation

GMS installation log is at `/var/apps/androidemu/var/gms_install.log`, check for specific failure reasons.

### Q: Already installed Standard Edition, want to add GMS?

A: Currently GMS can only be selected during installation. Users with Standard Edition need to:
1. Uninstall the current app (select "Keep data" — installed apps and data will not be lost)
2. Reinstall, select "Install GMS services and Play Store" in the wizard
3. Data is preserved after installation, GMS is installed automatically

### Q: What's the difference between this GMS and the old GMS edition image?

A:
- **Old GMS edition (before 3.8.7)**: Used third-party whojk/redroid image, GPU host mode incompatible with some hardware causing black screen
- **New GMS (3.8.7+)**: Uses official redroid Standard Edition image, GPU mode works normally; during installation, automatically detects architecture (x86_64/arm64) and extracts files from a separate GMS file carrier image to install to system partitions — no black screen issues; the app package itself does not contain GMS binaries, size is only ~150KB

### Q: Installation fails with "all mirror sources and Docker Hub official are unreachable"?

A: This happens when NAS Docker cannot access the image registry (the ~2GB Redroid system image pull fails).

**Cause:** The default fnOS mirror accelerator (docker.fnnas.com) or Docker Hub official source is unreachable in the current network environment.

**Solutions (in recommended order):**

1. **Configure a domestic mirror accelerator (recommended)**: Open fnOS **Docker → Image Registry → Settings → Mirror Settings**, add any of the following working addresses:
   - DaoCloud: `https://docker.m.daocloud.io`
   - Nanjing University: `https://docker.nju.edu.cn`
   - Shanghai Jiao Tong University: `https://docker.mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn`
   
   Save, wait for Docker to restart, then retry installation.

2. **Check proxy settings**: If NAS has a proxy configured, verify in **Docker → Image Registry → Settings → Proxy Settings** that the proxy can access Docker Hub; if no proxy but network egress is restricted, configure an accelerator first.

3. **Manual image import (offline)**: On a computer with internet, run `docker save redroid/redroid:12.0.0-latest -o redroid.tar`, transfer the tar file to NAS, then run `docker load -i redroid.tar`, and retry installation.

> The pre-install check detects network before pulling images. On failure, installation aborts and **existing data is not deleted**. Simply retry after fixing the network.

### Q: After installing GMS, scrcpy keeps connecting/disconnecting, then stabilizes after a while — is this normal?

A: Yes, this is normal behavior, not a bug.

**Cause:** After GMS installation completes, the Android container restarts. During reboot, the system reinitializes GMS core components (GmsCore, GoogleServicesFramework, Play Store, etc.), which perform in the background:
- First-boot dex optimization (dex2oat)
- Google Services Framework registration and permission initialization
- Play Store app list sync
- Network connection and Google server handshake (may timeout and retry on domestic networks)

This process typically lasts **1~3 minutes**, during which scrcpy shows "connecting" or repeatedly disconnects and reconnects — this is expected.

**Recommendations:**
- Wait patiently for 3 minutes after GMS installation; do not frequently refresh or restart the container
- If still unable to connect after 5 minutes, check container logs: `docker logs androidemu-android --tail 50`
- Google server connection timeout on domestic networks is normal and does not affect local app running — only affects Play Store login and cloud sync

### Q: After GMS installation completes, can the GMS image be deleted?

A: Yes. The GMS image (`ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:x86_64-1.0.0` or `arm64-1.0.0`, ~700MB) is only used during installation to extract GMS files and is no longer needed afterward.

**Automatic cleanup (3.8.7+ default enabled):** The install script automatically deletes the GMS image after successful installation, freeing ~700MB.

**Manual deletion:** If you need to clean up manually:
```bash
docker rmi ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:x86_64-1.0.0   # x86_64
docker rmi ghcr.io/lin1740/androidemu-gms:arm64-1.0.0    # arm64
```

> Note: After deletion, if you need to reinstall GMS in the future (e.g., after uninstalling and reinstalling), the image (~700MB) will be re-pulled from the registry.

### Q: Terminal docker commands fail with `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`

A: Your current user is not in the docker group and lacks permission to access the Docker daemon directly.

**Solutions (choose one):**
1. **Temporary**: Prefix all docker commands with `sudo`, e.g. `sudo docker ps`, `sudo docker exec androidemu-android ...`
2. **Permanent**: Add your user to the docker group, then re-login for changes to take effect:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker <your-username>
```
> Note: After adding to the docker group, you must **exit the terminal and log back in** for it to take effect.

### Q: How to configure multi-device resolution and switch dynamically?

A: Since v3.8.4, multi-device resolution configuration is supported. During installation, you can separately set resolutions for **PC, phone, and tablet**. The container starts with the phone resolution by default, and you can switch dynamically during use (takes effect immediately, no container restart needed).

**1. Set during installation (recommended)**

In the "Resolution Settings" step of the installation wizard, fill in resolutions for each device (format: width×height, e.g., 1920×1080):
- **PC**: e.g., 1920×1080 (landscape) or 1280×720
- **Phone**: e.g., 720×1440 (9:18 bezel-less, default) or 720×1280 (9:16)
- **Tablet**: e.g., 1200×2000 (3:5) or 800×1280

Leave blank to use defaults for that device (PC 1920×1080, phone 720×1440, tablet 1200×2000); if all blank, defaults are used.

**2. Auto-switch resolution **

After installation, the app automatically starts a "resolution auto-switch daemon". When you open the Chuanyun Cast page on different devices, the page automatically detects the device type and reports it. The daemon then **automatically switches to the corresponding resolution** (takes effect immediately).

- Opening on PC → auto-switches to PC resolution
- Opening on phone → auto-switches to phone resolution
- Opening on tablet → auto-switches to tablet resolution

> Cooldown 60 seconds: after a switch, no further switches for 60 seconds to avoid affecting experience. When multiple devices open simultaneously, the most recently opened device takes precedence.

**View auto-switch logs:**
```bash
cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/resolution_autoswitch.log
```

**3. Manually switch resolution**

If auto-switching does not work as expected, you can manually run:
```bash
# Switch to PC resolution
bash /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/scripts/switch_resolution.sh pc

# Switch to phone resolution
bash /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/scripts/switch_resolution.sh phone

# Switch to tablet resolution
bash /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/scripts/switch_resolution.sh tablet

# Specify custom resolution directly
bash /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/scripts/switch_resolution.sh 1080x1920
```

Switching is done via `adb shell wm size`, **takes effect immediately**, no container restart or reconnection needed.

**3. View current configuration**
```bash
cat /var/apps/androidemu/var/resolution.conf
```

**4. Permanently change default resolution (modify compose)**

To change the default resolution at container startup (takes effect after restart), edit the compose file:
```bash
nano /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/docker/docker-compose.yaml
```
Find the `command` section of the `redroid` service and modify:
```yaml
- androidboot.redroid_width=720
- androidboot.redroid_height=1600
```
Then restart the container:
```bash
cd /vol1/@appcenter/androidemu/docker
docker compose up -d --force-recreate redroid
```

> **Notes**:
> - The container can only use one resolution at a time; after switching, all connected clients will see the new resolution
> - Dynamic switching does not delete data or installed apps
> - When resolution ratio matches the device screen ratio, immersive borderless fullscreen is achieved
> - 1080p and higher resolutions demand more NAS performance; low-spec devices are recommended to use 720p series

### Q: Container is laggy, frozen, unresponsive to clicks or gestures

A: **v3.7.0+ users**: Open the app page. If the upstream service is temporarily unavailable, a friendly status page will automatically appear, including:
- **Health Status**: Auto-detects boot status, uptime, OOM kills, whether surfaceflinger/agent are running
- **One-Click Fix Buttons**:
  - "Fix GPU/Screen": Auto chmod /dev/dri + restart surfaceflinger (fixes screen freeze caused by GPU permission issues)
  - "Restart Android Container": Restarts the entire Android container
  - "Restart Screen Service": Restarts only surfaceflinger, other processes unaffected

**General troubleshooting (all versions):**
1. Close the app page (or browser tab), reopen it and try clicking/swiping again
2. If still unresponsive, go to the app detail page in fnOS App Center, click "Stop", then "Start" again
3. If only one container is laggy, find that container in Docker and click "Restart"
4. Manually check health status (run one by one):

   Check if container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter name=androidemu
   ```

   Check if Android finished booting:
   ```bash
   docker exec androidemu-android getprop sys.boot_completed
   ```

   Check if killed by OOM:
   ```bash
   docker inspect -f '{{.State.OOMKilled}}' androidemu-android
   ```
5. If none of the above works, please capture a screenshot or screen recording of the lag, and export the Docker container logs as a text file, then submit via any of the feedback channels below

### Q: Android container memory is very low (<300MB), device stays offline

A: A normal Android 12 should use 300MB+ after boot. If the container is running but memory is only 100-200MB, Android has not finished booting (`boot_completed != 1`), so the agent cannot be deployed and the device never comes online. Troubleshoot:

**1. Check boot status:**
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android getprop sys.boot_completed
```
- Returns `1` → booted, skip to step 3
- Returns empty or `0` → not booted, continue to step 2

**2. Check boot logs:**
```bash
docker logs androidemu-android --tail 80 2>&1 | grep -iE "error|fail|panic|binder|surface|zygote|boot"
```

| Log keyword | Cause | Fix |
|------------|-------|-----|
| `binder`, `binderfs` | binder driver missing | x86: install `binder_linux` from App Center first, then `docker restart androidemu-android` |
| `SurfaceFlinger`, `gpu`, `dri` | GPU passthrough failed | Run GPU fix commands below |
| `out of memory`, `lowmemory` | Insufficient RAM | Close other apps, keep at least 2GB free |
| `zygote` restarting | System service crash | Reinitialize data volume (wipes Android data): `docker compose -p androidemu down && docker volume rm androidemu-data && docker compose -p androidemu up -d` |

**3. GPU fix (for graphical glitches or SurfaceFlinger crashes, run in order):**

Step 1: Fix GPU device permissions
```bash
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android chmod 666 /dev/dri/card0 /dev/dri/renderD128
```

Step 2: Restart screen service
```bash
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android sh -c 'setprop ctl.restart surfaceflinger'
```

Step 3: Wait 60 seconds for service restart
```bash
sleep 60
```

Step 4: Confirm Android boot completed
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android getprop sys.boot_completed
```

**4. Manual agent injection (when boot_completed=1 but device still offline, run in order):**

> Note: Replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NAS actual LAN IP; use `amd64` for x86 devices, `arm64` for ARM devices.
>
> **Permission note**: If docker commands fail with `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`, your user is not in the docker group. Prefix all docker commands with `sudo`, or add your user to the docker group (`sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`, then re-login).

Step 1: Extract agent from scrcpy-over-webrtc image (first time only)
```bash
docker run --rm -v /var/apps/androidemu/var/agent:/out --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.fnnas.com/buutuu/scrcpy-over-webrtc:latest -c "cp /app/agent_binaries/cloudphone-agent-amd64 /app/agent_binaries/libsys_core.so /out/ && chmod 755 /out/cloudphone-agent-amd64"
```

Step 2: Copy agent binary to Android container
```bash
docker cp /var/apps/androidemu/var/agent/cloudphone-agent-amd64 androidemu-android:/data/local/tmp/cloudphone-agent
```

Step 3: Copy dependency library to Android container
```bash
docker cp /var/apps/androidemu/var/agent/libsys_core.so androidemu-android:/data/local/tmp/libsys_core.so
```

Step 4: Inject and start agent (replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NAS LAN IP)
```bash
docker exec -u 0 androidemu-android sh -c "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/cloudphone-agent && export CP_AGENT_JAR=/data/local/tmp/libsys_core.so && nohup /data/local/tmp/cloudphone-agent -signaling wss://<NAS_IP>:8443/register_agent -id androidemu -ice-servers 'turn:cloudphone_user:cloudphone_secure_password@<NAS_IP>:3478?transport=udp,turn:cloudphone_user:cloudphone_secure_password@<NAS_IP>:3478?transport=tcp,stun:<NAS_IP>:3478' -jar /data/local/tmp/libsys_core.so > /data/local/tmp/agent.log 2>&1 &"
```

Step 5: Wait 3 seconds
```bash
sleep 3
```

Step 6: Confirm agent is running (returns PID means success)
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android pidof cloudphone-agent
```

### Q: Android container starts very slowly (over 5 minutes), memory fluctuates a lot, system unstable

A: Versions before v3.8.3 had an issue with lmkd (Low Memory Killer Daemon) thresholds being too low: the default maximum threshold was only 315MB, which was too aggressive for large memory systems, causing frequent killing of empty processes during startup and repeated restarts of system services. This manifested as slow startup, memory fluctuating between 2.0-2.5GB, and the device staying offline for a long time.

**Fixed in v3.8.3+**: lmkd thresholds raised to 512/768/1024/1280/2048/3072MB, dex2oat uses verify-only mode on first boot to speed up startup, and key process priorities are automatically raised after boot. Upgrading to v3.8.3+ will resolve this.

If the problem persists, please check:
1. Host available memory ≥2GB (`free -h`)
2. Whether other apps are consuming large amounts of memory (e.g., fnOS Photos, downloads, etc.)
3. Container logs for OOM or crashes (`docker logs androidemu-android --tail 50`)

### Q: WebRTC connection fails, black screen, or endless loading

A: The most common cause is `PUBLIC_IP` being reset to `127.0.0.1` (after container recreation, the compose default takes effect), so the TURN relay address handed to clients is `127.0.0.1`, which clients cannot reach.

**Diagnostic commands (run one by one to check results):**

Check PUBLIC_IP configuration:
```bash
docker inspect androidemu-webrtc --format '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' | grep PUBLIC_IP
```

Check if agent is running:
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android pidof cloudphone-agent || echo "agent not running"
```

Check agent log (last 20 lines):
```bash
docker exec androidemu-android tail -20 /data/local/tmp/agent.log 2>/dev/null
```

Check errors in webrtc container log:
```bash
docker logs androidemu-webrtc --tail 40 2>&1 | grep -iE 'relay addr|allocation|error|fail|Unauthorized' | tail -15
```

**Fix (when PUBLIC_IP=127.0.0.1, run in order, replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NAS LAN IP):**

Step 1: Enter docker config directory
```bash
cd /var/apps/androidemu/target/docker
```

Step 2: Replace PUBLIC_IP (replace `<NAS_IP>` with your NAS LAN IP)
```bash
sed -i 's/PUBLIC_IP=127\.0\.0\.1/PUBLIC_IP=<NAS_IP>/g' docker-compose.yaml
```

Step 3: Recreate webrtc container
```bash
docker compose -p androidemu up -d --force-recreate webrtc
```

Step 4: Wait 10 seconds
```bash
sleep 10
```

Step 5: Confirm PUBLIC_IP updated
```bash
docker inspect androidemu-webrtc --format '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' | grep PUBLIC_IP
```

After confirming `PUBLIC_IP` is your LAN IP, reopen the cloud phone page to connect.

### Q: No sound / Low volume

A: **Audio is fixed in version 3.7.3+**, Opus software encoder is enabled by default. If still no sound, please check the following points:

1. **Manually enable audio in connection settings**:
   - Desktop (fnOS Web interface): Check the "Audio" option in CloudPhone connection settings
   - Mobile (CloudPhone APP): Audio stream is pass-through, no additional setup needed; ensure APP version supports audio
2. **Volume is linked with host system volume**:
   - Final volume = in-container volume × host system volume
   - Example: container set to 100%, but host system volume only at 50%, actual output is 50%
   - Please check both in-container media volume and host system volume
3. **When using third-party control/connection software**:
   - If using software other than CloudPhone (such as scrcpy, QtScrcpy, ADB remote control, etc.), be sure to **disable audio** in that software's settings, or configure audio correctly according to the software's instructions
   - Third-party software may not be compatible with CloudPhone's Opus audio stream protocol; forcing audio on may cause connection failure or no sound
   - CloudPhone APP and fnOS Web interface have built-in audio support; official clients are recommended

> Technical note: redroid image defaults to `debug.stagefright.ccodec=0` which disables the Codec2 framework, causing opus encoder not to load. Version 3.7.3 uses `audio_fix.py` watchdog to automatically set `debug.stagefright.ccodec=1` to enable Codec2, and auto-restores after container reboot.

### Q: External network screen laggy

A: External network via fnOS reverse proxy auto-uses WebSocket casting, framerate limited by upstream bandwidth. If you have public IP, recommend directly mapping port 8443 for WebRTC casting.

### Q: Clicking "Terminal" pops up print dialog

A: This is Scrcpy frontend shortcut conflict bug. Fixed via RUNTIME_SHIM blocking `window.print()` and Ctrl+P shortcut, clicking terminal no longer triggers printing.

### Q: Audit log loading failed

A: Audit log function depends on Scrcpy backend `/api/audit` endpoint, some versions may not support. This is upstream image feature, doesn't affect core casting function.

### Q: How to delete uploaded APK files in scrcpy-over-webrtc? "Remove" button doesn't work

A: The "Remove" button only removes the file from the current install task — it does **not** delete the file from the cloud file center. Files are stored in the webrtc container at `/app/data/downloads/`. Delete them from the container:

Step 1: List uploaded files
```bash
docker exec androidemu-webrtc ls -la /app/data/downloads/
```

Step 2: Delete all APKs (or specify a filename to delete one)
```bash
sudo docker exec androidemu-webrtc sh -c 'rm -rf /app/data/downloads/*'
```

Step 3: Clear file metadata (otherwise the dropdown still shows filenames)
```bash
docker exec androidemu-webrtc sh -c 'echo "{}" > /app/data/files_meta.json'
```

Refresh the page after deletion, and the "Select existing file from cloud" dropdown will be empty.

### Q: APK upload via scrcpy-over-webrtc fails to install, how to install manually?

A: Uploaded APKs are stored in the webrtc container at `/app/data/downloads/`. If the UI install fails, you can install manually via command line:

**Step 1: List uploaded APK files**
```bash
sudo docker exec androidemu-webrtc ls -la /app/data/downloads/
```

**Step 2: Copy APK to host temp directory**
```bash
sudo docker cp androidemu-webrtc:/app/data/downloads/your-app.apk /tmp/
```

**Step 3: Copy to Android container**
```bash
sudo docker cp /tmp/your-app.apk androidemu-android:/data/local/tmp/
```

**Step 4: Install inside Android container**
```bash
sudo docker exec androidemu-android pm install /data/local/tmp/your-app.apk
```

**Step 5 (optional): Clean up temp files**
```bash
sudo docker exec androidemu-android rm /data/local/tmp/your-app.apk
sudo rm /tmp/your-app.apk
```

> The above commands have been verified on both x86 and ARM platforms. Replace `your-app.apk` with the actual filename.

### Q: How to uninstall

A: Click "Uninstall" in fnOS App Center. Container data (Android /data partition) kept in Docker volume, to completely remove:
```bash
docker volume rm androidemu_data androidemu-webrtc-data
```

### Q: Can't reinstall after cancelling installation/update midway

A: Fixed in v3.6.0+, auto-cleans temporary data on interruption. If using old version and encountering this, manually clean:
Step 1: Clean temporary files
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/androidemu_*
```

Step 2: Remove leftover containers
```bash
docker rm -f androidemu-android androidemu-webrtc 2>/dev/null
```

### Technical Notes & Development Pitfalls

Key technical conclusions verified during development, for secondary development reference:

- **com.android.location.fused absolutely cannot be disabled**: It's a dependency of LocationManagerService, disabling causes system_server crash, Android won't boot
- **androidboot.use_memfd=1 unsafe on redroid 12**: Causes LocationManagerService crash, init kills zygote, memory drops from 600-700MB to 400MB, container can't start
- **Detect dependency apps by device node not directory name**: App Center display name and actual directory name may differ, detecting `/dev/binder` more reliable than `/var/apps/binder_linux_driver`
- **WebSocket proxy must cover all ws/wss URLs**: Can't only cover specific paths, otherwise other paths will directly connect to port 8443 causing CORS failure when accessed via gateway
- **BusyBox su resets environment variables**: Non-root transformation can't use su -c internal export to pass env vars, should set directly in docker-compose environment
- **Disable Bluetooth with pm disable not svc disable**: svc disable gets auto-restarted by system, pm disable can completely disable
- **fnOS Docker no host hairpin capability**: Bridge containers can't access host LAN IP, ADB port needs socat forwarding
- **redroid Android main container must be privileged**: Upstream official requirement, non-privileged tested can't boot, but only applies inside container, app itself doesn't request host root
- **Upgrade scripts must be robust**: fnOS upgrade process first executes old version uninstall_init, any command failure or stdout output causes "script execution error with unknown reason", must set +e + output redirect + all commands || true
- **CRLF line endings cause Linux script errors**: All shell/Python scripts must use LF line endings, otherwise `$'\r': command not found`
- **App process downgrade needs attention to IPC**: After gateway.py downgrade, `is_mine(pid)` can only check current user processes, audio watchdog must also downgrade to same user, otherwise gets repeatedly started

## Known Limitations

> **About Standalone Docker Container Version**: This project is currently published as an fnOS App Center FPK package. Standalone Docker Compose deployment is not yet available. The standalone Docker container version is planned for release after the app is stable on the App Center. Stay tuned.

1. **Audio**: Enabled in 3.7.3+ (Codec2 Opus software encoder), need to manually enable in connection settings
2. **External network access**: fnOS reverse proxy only passes TCP, WebRTC media stream (UDP) can't pass, auto-downgrades to WebSocket casting
3. **fnOS APP**: Some versions WebView has limited WebSocket proxy support, recommend mobile browser
4. **ARM app compatibility**: ARM64 apps with anti-emulator detection or complex JIT may crash (translation layer capability boundary)
5. **redroid privileged mode**: Android main container needs privileged (redroid upstream official requirement, non-privileged tested can't boot), but only applies inside container, app itself doesn't request host root
6. **Scrcpy device count authorization**: Free version has device count limit, paid only increases device count, doesn't affect functionality

2. This project is for learning and research purposes only, and must not be used for any illegal purpose.
3. The publisher is not responsible for any data loss, system failure, or service interruption caused by using this application.
4. Third-party components integrated in the application (redroid, scrcpy-over-webrtc, etc.) are maintained by their respective authors, and their functionality, stability, and compliance are not controlled by this project.
5. Users should back up important data themselves; this application does not guarantee the security and integrity of data in the container.
6. This application itself does not actively collect your personal privacy data; all runtime data is stored on your local device. However, please note that when using third-party authorized services such as scrcpy-over-webrtc, necessary data such as your device identifier and network requests will be sent to upstream official servers for authorization verification and signaling connections. Please refer to the upstream service's privacy policy for details.
7. **Regarding GMS (Google Mobile Services)**: GMS (including Google Play Services, Google Play Store, Google Services Framework, etc.) is proprietary software of Google LLC, protected by copyright law and relevant international treaties. The application package itself **does not contain any GMS binaries**; only after the user actively selects "Install GMS" does the script extract files from a separate GMS file carrier image at runtime and install them into the Android container. By selecting to install GMS, you acknowledge and understand that: (1) Use of GMS is subject to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; (2) This project has not obtained official authorization or MADA certification from Google, and the distribution and use of GMS may carry legal risks, limited to personal learning and research purposes only; (3) After installation, GMS may have compatibility issues with some applications or system components, and this project is not responsible for any functional abnormalities, data loss, or system instability resulting therefrom; (4) If you intend to use it for commercial purposes or large-scale distribution, you must obtain formal authorization from Google yourself, otherwise you may face legal risks. Commercial users are recommended to consider open-source compliant alternatives such as microG.

### Open Source Obligations

1. **GPL-2.0 Component Obligations**: redroid-modules (kernel modules) and in-container Linux kernel related code follow the GPL-2.0 license. This application only pulls the redroid image from public repositories at runtime, without modifying or redistributing its source code or binaries. Legally, this constitutes "mere aggregation" and does not constitute a derivative work. However, if users modify, recompile, or redistribute the above GPL-2.0 components, they must strictly comply with GPL-2.0 open source obligations (including publishing modified source code, retaining copyright notices, etc.).
2. **Apache 2.0 Component Obligations**: Components following the Apache 2.0 license such as AOSP and scrcpy must retain copyright notices, license copies, and NOTICE files when redistributed.
3. **MIT / BSD Component Obligations**: Components following MIT or BSD licenses such as ya-webadb, Pion WebRTC, xterm.js, coturn, and Go standard library must retain copyright notices, license statements, and disclaimers when redistributed. MIT/BSD licenses are relatively permissive, allowing modification, redistribution, and commercial use, but original copyright and license statements must be retained.
4. **Proprietary Components**: libndk_translation (Google) and libhoudini (Intel) are vendor proprietary components; this application does not redistribute them, only uses them with upstream images or auto-downloads at runtime; users should comply with the corresponding vendor's terms of use.
5. **scrcpy-over-webrtc Components**: Frontend source code is under MIT license, freely modifiable; official binary core components are for personal learning, technical research, and non-commercial testing only.
⚠️ **Commercial Use Warning**: If you plan to use this software in any commercial environment (including but not limited to internal corporate commercial use, providing commercial cloud phone services to external parties, etc.), you must contact upstream author hqw700 in advance to obtain commercial authorization, or replace the core components with open-source alternatives that permit commercial use.
   > **Commercial Use Definition**: Any use involving financial gain or organizational/business purposes constitutes commercial use, including but not limited to: paid sales/subscriptions, fee-based external services, internal business use by enterprises, pre-installation on hardware for sale, advertising/data monetization, as part of custom development deliverables, etc. Personal learning/research and non-commercial home use are generally not considered commercial use. Commercial use of GMS additionally requires formal authorization from Google (e.g., MADA).
6. **This Project's Code**: Packaging scripts and configs are released under the Apache License 2.0, freely usable, modifiable, and distributable, with copyright notices, license copies, and NOTICE files (if any) retained, and modifications to original files stated.

### Additional Notes

1. **Trademarks and Logos**: The names, trademarks, and logos of redroid, scrcpy-over-webrtc, scrcpy, WebRTC, and other projects belong to their respective authors or organizations. This project uses these names only for technical integration descriptions, does not claim any trademark rights, and does not imply any official partnership or endorsement with these projects.
2. **Project Endorsement**: The integration and use of upstream open source components in this project only represents technical compatibility adaptation, and does not represent the upstream authors' recognition, recommendation, or endorsement of this project; the quality, security, and maintenance of each upstream component are the responsibility of its original authors.
3. **Upstream Changes**: Upstream open source projects may adjust features, interfaces, or license terms with version iterations. This project will try to follow up and adapt, but is not responsible for compatibility issues or license status changes caused by upstream changes; in case of major changes, please refer to the official announcements of each upstream project.
4. **Component Integrity**: This application pulls upstream official images from public container repositories at runtime, and does not modify or repackage the code inside the images; if users replace or modify upstream images on their own, any functional anomalies or compliance issues resulting therefrom are the user's responsibility.
5. **Patent Licensing**: The Apache 2.0 license includes patent grant clauses from contributors, while MIT and BSD licenses do not involve explicit patent grants; users should assess patent risks on their own when using, modifying, or redistributing related components.
6. **Export Control**: Some codec and encryption technologies involved in this project may be subject to export control regulations of certain countries or regions; users should ensure compliance with relevant local laws and regulations when using or redistributing across borders.
7. **Omission & Errata Notice**: Due to the complex dependency relationships of upstream open source projects, the license information, project links of some transitive dependencies or sub-components may not be fully listed or accurately noted in this section. If you find any open source project that should be listed but is omitted, any license status errors, or any incorrect project links, we sincerely apologize and welcome you to inform us through any of the "Feedback Links & Channels" below (except for the 4th channel, which is the dedicated feedback channel for upstream components). We will verify and supplement/correct it in a timely manner.
8. **Source Code Release**: The packaging scripts and configs of this project are released under the Apache License 2.0, but the publication of source code may be handled at our discretion based on actual circumstances. For example, the source code of beta/inner-test versions may not be publicly available temporarily due to stability, security, or other reasons, while the source code of public release versions is usually published to this repository simultaneously. The actual content published in this repository shall prevail.
